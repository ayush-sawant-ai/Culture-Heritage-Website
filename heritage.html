<section>
  <h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
  <p>Agra Fort, also known as the Red Fort of Agra, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh.
     Built in 1565 by Emperor Akbar, it served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors until 1638. 
     The fort witnessed the rule of Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, making it a key center of power during the Mughal era.
     Originally a brick fort held by Rajputs, Akbar rebuilt it with red sandstone. His grandson, Shah Jahan, added beautiful white marble structures, including the Musamman Burj, where he was later imprisoned by his own son, Aurangzeb.
    The fort has seen battles, royal dramas, and love stories, all locked within its massive walls.

  <h1>Great Living Chola Temples</h1>
  <p></p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
  <p>The Great Living Chola Temples are remarkable examples of South Indian temple architecture, constructed during the reign of the Chola dynasty, one of India’s longest-ruling empires, between the 11th and 12th centuries CE.
     These temples reflect the zenith of Chola architectural, cultural, and spiritual accomplishments. The Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, built in 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola I, is renowned for its towering 216-foot Vimana made from a single granite block, a massive 25-ton Nandi statue, and exquisite murals and frescoes that narrate Hindu mythology—still serving as an active place of worship. 
     The Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple, built by his son Rajendra Chola I to commemorate his victories in northern India, exhibits a more refined and artistic architectural style and houses a grand Shiva Lingam alongside detailed stone carvings. The Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram, constructed by Rajaraja Chola II, is noted for its intricate design, stone chariot, and beautifully carved pillars, and is named after Airavata, the white elephant of Indra who is believed to have worshipped there.
     Together, these temples showcase the Chola dynasty’s deep devotion to Lord Shiva and their exceptional skills in architecture, engineering, and bronze casting.
